## 👀 About the project

The game app mata mosquito is an application developed with the intention of practicing the initial concepts in JavaScript learned in the module of the course **complete web**, from [Udemy].

 ### 🎮 How it works 🤔
 
The game works in a simple way, the player (user) chooses between the 3 difficulty levels shown on the game's initial screen, and has 3 attempts, a certain time interval, and if the player does not kill the mosquitoes he will lose the attempts , when he loses all of them it's game over, but if he manages to pass the time and doesn't lose all his lives, he wins.
